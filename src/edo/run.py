    """ Run a genetic algorithm under the presented constraints, giving a
    population of artificial datasets for which the given fitness function
    performs well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fitness : func
        Any real-valued function that takes one :class:`pandas.DataFrame` as
        argument. Any further arguments should be passed to
        :code:`fitness_kwargs`.
    size : int
        The size of the population to create.
    row_limits : list
        Lower and upper bounds on the number of rows a dataset can have.
    col_limits : list
        Lower and upper bounds on the number of columns a dataset can have.

        Tuples can also be used to specify the min/maximum number of columns
        there can be of each type in :code:`families`.
    families : list
        Used to create the initial population and instruct the GA how a column
        should be manipulated in a dataset.

        .. note::
            For reproducibility, a user-defined class' :code:`sample` method
            should use NumPy for)any random elements as the seed for the GA is
            set using :func:`np.random.seed`.
    weights : list
        A probability distribution on how to select columns from
        :code:`families`. If :code:`None`, families will be chosen uniformly.
    stop : func
        A function which acts as a stopping condition on the GA. Such functions
        should take only the fitness of the current population as argument, and
        should return a boolean variable. If :code:`None`, the GA will run up
        until its maximum number of iterations.
    dwindle : func
        A function which acts as a means of dwindling the mutation probability.
        Such functions should take the current mutation probability and the
        current iteration as argument, and should return a new mutation
        probability. If :code:`None`, the GA will run with a constant mutation
        probability.
    max_iter : int
        The maximum number of iterations to be carried out before terminating.
    best_prop : float
        The proportion of a population from which to select the "best" potential
        parents.
    lucky_prop : float
        The proportion of a population from which to sample some "lucky"
        potential parents. Set to zero as standard.
    crossover_prob : float
        The probability with which to sample dimensions from the first parent
        over the second in a crossover operation. Defaults to 0.5.
    mutation_prob : float
        The probability of a particular characteristic in an individual's
        dataset being mutated. If using :code:`dwindle`, this is an initial
        probability.
    shrinkage : float
        The relative size to shrink each parameter's limits by for each
        distribution in :code:`families`. Defaults to `None` but must be between 0
        and 1 (not inclusive).
    maximise : bool
        Determines whether :code:`fitness` is a function to be maximised or not.
        Fitness scores are minimised by default.
    seed : int
        The seed for a particular run of the genetic algorithm. If :code:`None`,
        no seed is set.
    processes : int
        The number of processes to use in order to parallelise several
        processes. Defaults to `None` where the algorithm is executed serially.
    root : str
        The directory in which to write all generations to file. Defaults to
        `None` where nothing is written to file. Instead, everything is kept in
        memory and returned at the end. If writing to file, one generation is
        held in memory at a time and everything is returned in `dask` objects.
    fitness_kwargs : dict
        Any additional parameters that need to be passed to :code:`fitness`
        should be placed here as a dictionary or suitable mapping.

    Returns
    -------
    population : list
        The final population.
    pop_fitness : list
        The fitness of all individuals in the final population.
    pop_history : list
        Every population in each generation.
    fit_history : list
        Every individual's fitness in each generation.
