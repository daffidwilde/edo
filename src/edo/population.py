    Parameters
    ----------
    size : int
        The number of individuals in the population.
    row_limits : list
        Limits on the number of rows a dataset can have.
    col_limits : list
        Limits on the number of columns a dataset can have.
    families : list
        A list of ``edo.Family`` instances that handle the column distribution
        classes.
    weights : list
        Relative weights with which to sample from ``families``. If ``None``,
        sampling is done uniformly.
    random_states : dict
        A mapping of the index of the population to a
        ``numpy.random.RandomState`` instance that is to be assigned to the
        individual at that index in the population.

    -------

        A population of newly created individuals.
