    Parameters
    ----------
    size : int
        The number of individuals in the population.
    row_limits : list
        Limits on the number of rows a dataset can have.
    col_limits : list
        Limits on the number of columns a dataset can have.
    pdfs : list
        A list of potential column pdf classes such as those found in
        `pdfs.py`. Must have a `.sample()` and `.mutate()` method.
    weights : list
        A sequence of relative weights the same length as `column_classes`. This
        acts as a loose probability distribution from which to sample column
        classes. If `None`, column classes are sampled equally.

    -------
    population : list
        A collection of individuals.
