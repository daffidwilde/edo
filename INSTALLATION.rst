Installation
------------

Edo is built on Python 3, and relies only on `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
and `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_. Hence, no additional installs are
required. In addition to this, however, `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
(2.2+) is assumed for these tutorials.

With that being said, the library is most easily installed using :code:`pip`::

    $ pip install edo

However, if you would like to install it from source then go ahead and clone the
GitHub repo::

    $ git clone https://github.com/daffidwilde/edo.git
    $ cd edo
    $ python setup.py install
