Setting seeds
=============

Evolutionary algorithms are meta-heuristics and so are stochastic in nature.
Therefore, it is a good idea to set a seed for the pseudo-random number
generator when running the algorithm. By doing this, the same run can be
executed again and again, and you will always obtain the same results.

A short example of how to do this is given here_.
