Welcome to GeneticData's documentation!
=======================================

GeneticData provides a framework for generating collections of effective
artificial datasets through the application of a genetic algorithm (GA).

Consider a specific algorithm, and its objective function. This GA can take that
objective function as its own fitness function to create generations of datasets
for which that algorithm performs increasingly well at.

Through this approach, a user can not only create banks of effective datasets
for their own use, but can also be able to determine and study the preferred
characteristics of such datasets. This is made easy for a user by considering
each individual in a population to be a pair: one part being the dataset itself,
and the other being a list of distributions from which the column's values are
generated.
