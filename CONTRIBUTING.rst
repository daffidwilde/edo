How to contribute
=================

Contributions are always welcome! Whether they come in the form of providing a
fix for a current `issue <https://github.com/daffidwilde/edo/issues>`_,
reporting a bug, a contribution to the code itself, or a discussion of the
library as a whole. Pull requests (PRs) will be reviewed, and collaborative work
is always encouraged!

To make a contribution via a PR, follow these steps:

1. Go to the `GitHub repo <https://github.com/daffidwilde/edo>`_,
   make a fork, and clone the repo locally::

       $ git clone git@github.com/<your-username>/edo.git

2. Ensure that all the tests pass (this can take a few minutes)::

       $ cd edo
       $ pytest tests

3. Make your changes and write tests to go with them -- ensuring they pass, too.

4. Push to your fork and open a pull request!
